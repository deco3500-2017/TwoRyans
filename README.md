This is the repository for team TwoRyans for DECO3500, 2017. It will house the code for their project, FastFacts, a versatile, interactive learning tool that can be used by teachers to get students active, while also quizzing them on class content.

# Introduction  
FastFacts aims to solve two dilemmas often faced by teachers in modern day classrooms. Firstly, teachers often find it difficult to get students to engaged with the content they're presenting. Interacting with presented material can often help tactile, visual or aural learners retain information better, which can be the difference between cementing and forgetting a concept.

The second dilemma is that teachers often find it difficult to keep students active while they are at school. With the obesity epidemic still looming over Australia, it is often a priority for teachers to make sure students are getting enough excersise during school hours.

FastFacts solves these dilemmas by providing an innovative, interactive learning tool for teachers that will get students up and moving in the classroom, while it the same time cementing their knowledge on facts from any number of academic disciplines.

# Concept
## The Idea
FastFacts will utilize Makey Makey to create a fun, interactive classroom quiz game. The teacher will set up the room by displaying the MakeyMakey application on the screen, and placing several items around the room that will serve as answers to the quiz they have constructed. Students are then divided into two or more teams, with a baton/button in the center of the room for each team.  

#The Plan

##Research
1. Identify primary users
    - interview
    - focus group
2. Create user personas
3. Establish context of product usage
    - physical
    - technological
4. Establish tools required for next stage
    - programs
    - physical protoyping material

##Protoyping
1. Determine system structure
    - task flow
    - UI
    - Style guide
    - architecture
2.Prototype Development
    - digital wireframes
    - paper protoyping
    - low fidelity
2. User Testing
    - Questionnaire
    - Qualitative data

##Implementation
1. Front End
2. Back End
3. User testing
    - high fidelity
    - larger sample size
