# TwoRyans
This is the repository for team TwoRyans for DECO3500, 2017. It will house the code for their project, FastFacts, a versatile, interactive learning tool that can be used by teachers to get students active, while also quizzing them on class content.

# Introduction  
FastFacts aims to solve two dilemmas often faced by teachers in modern day classrooms. Firstly, teachers often find it difficult to get students to engaged with the content they're presenting. Interacting with presented material can often help tactile, visual or aural learners retain information better, which can be the difference between cementing and forgetting a concept.

The second dilemma is that teachers often find it difficult to keep students active while they are at school. With the obesity epidemic still looming over Australia, it is often a priority for teachers to make sure students are getting enough excersise during school hours.

FastFacts solves these dilemmas by providing an innovative, interactive learning tool for teachers that will get students up and moving in the classroom, while it the same time cementing their knowledge on facts from any number of academic disciplines.

# Concept
## The Idea
FastFacts will utilize Makey Makey to create a fun, interactive classroom quiz game. The teacher will set up the room by displaying the MakeyMakey application on the screen, and placing several items around the room that will serve as answers to the quiz they have constructed. Students are then divided into two or more teams, with a baton/button in the center of the room for each team. Questions are then flashed up onto the board, with the first student managing to run towards and touch the correct answer gaining points for their team.

## Innovation
While there are other applications available that allow teachers to customize revision tests, and applications that help students through visual learning, FastFacts will be the first application that does both at the same time, as well as the first application to incorporate physical artifacts as answers to classroom questions.

## The Audience
The intended audience will be middle school students from grades 4-7. Students who are visual or tactile learning will likely benefit the most from using FastFacts. Outside of these parameters, the application is designed to have a large number of use cases, so the audience may change depending on the specific application of game by a given teacher. The target audience should also have already been primed by the teacher on the chosen topic so that they are likely to get at least some of the questions correct.


# Team

Team Member             | Student Number |    Key Roles
----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------
Ryan de Weijer          | 43210299       | UX / Front End Designer
Ryan Pousson            | 43181326       | Team Leader / App Development
Martinus Kamangudi      | 44595809       | Researcher
Annie Huang             | 43257490       | UX / Front End Programmer

The table above outlines each member and their respective key roles and contributions to the project. Ryan Pousson has been elected as the Team Leader and will manage the project and ensure timeframes and schedules are being adhered to. Each individual is responsible for their own transport and everything else pertaining to the logistics of attending meetings (both physical and virtual) - further details are noted below under **Communications**. 

## Workload Distribution and Responsibility

All members will attend the workshop on Tuesday 08:00-10:00 and arrange additional weekly team meetings on a case by case basis. All members will contribute to the project workload equally, and agree to undertake and complete project tasks assigned to them in a timely manner. 

Where members cannot complete a task in the required time, they will notify the rest of the group immediately to reallocate the task or ask for assistance.
All members agree to complete tasks to the best of their ability, and to ask for assistance when unable to do so. 


## Decision Making
With regards to decision-making and relevant policies, the team will arrange to make most major decisions during the weekly Workshops (Tuesdays 08:00-10:00), but it is crucial that each person is easily contactable via the specified Discord chat to allocate given 


## Rule Breaches
In the first instance, a meeting will be called to discuss the breach. The offending group member will have the opportunity to respond in his defence. The allegations and proposed solution will be documented and shared with all members in Google Docs.

If no action is taken on the part of the offending member to rectify the issues, a further meeting will be called and the allegations and proposed solution will be shared with all group members and a copy will be emailed to the course coordinator. Attempts will be made to contact that person via another method to address the issues.

If the offending member makes no attempt to rectify the issues following two attempts to address the issue directly, the course staff will step in to assist.


# Communication

The group agrees to use a designated Discord server (channel name: #deco3500) as the primary method of communication, as it includes both messaging, as well as group audio-calls which are easily toggled on/off within Discord. Because of its flexibility and compatibility on desktop as well as mobile, it is believed that this will facilitate communication in the clearest and most efficient way possible.

For more casual communication and scheduling meetings, the group will use Facebook Messenger, and in the rare cases of emergencies, the group agrees to call using the Facebook Messenger service.

All group members agree to respond to communications from other group members in a timely manner, and they each agree to communicate effectively and treat each other with respect, consideration and dignity. Where criticism is given, it will be given in a constructive and respectful manner. The team Github repository will be the only location for relevant code to be amalgamated, and group members will commit code to Github in a timely and appropriate manner. 

## File Sharing

All files will be shared in a designated Google Drive folder and will provide constant access for all members at any given time. File-naming conventions will follow this structure: DocumentType_OwnerInitials. Including the Team Name has been deemed unnecessary as it is contained in the Google Drive Folder itself. 

# The Plan

## Research
1. Identify primary users
    - interview
    - focus group
2. Create user personas
3. Establish context of product usage

4. Establish tools required for next stage
    - programs
    - physical protoyping material

## Prototyping
1. Determine system structure
    - task flow
    - UI
    - Style guide
    - architecture
2.Prototype Development
    - digital wireframes
    - paper protoyping
    - low fidelity
2. User Testing
